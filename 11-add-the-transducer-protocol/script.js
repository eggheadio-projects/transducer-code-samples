/**
 * LESSON: transduce over Immutable.js collections
 * - show how map and filter works with Immutable.List
 * - can't use seq as it can only handle arrays and objects, but we CAN use our transduce fn
 * - forced to call .fromJS to create a new Immutable.List after transduce finished.
 * - now we can unwrap anything, but not wrap it back up without saying how.
 * - add the ability for the data structure to say 'how'.
 * - implement protocol so that we can use seq with any structure
